# To-Do Next

* Write here how we can improve the quality of our software development. 3-5 items would be sufficient.
* You can add any other suggestion here as well.

* Code should be written with explanatory comments to ease reading and changing it.
* Code should be written in pieces and every piece and functions should be dedicated to one job.
* Code should be committed frequently and meaningfully to ease future changes on it.
* Best practices should be researched and software development should be done according to these practices.
